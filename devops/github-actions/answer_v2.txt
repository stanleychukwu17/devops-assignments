  1. what are they?
    Github workflows are workflows that run in response to certain events/actions within our code
    repository @ github, each workflow should have at-least 1-job and each job can have multiple steps,
    but should have at-least 1 step. and a step can either be a shell-command or an action from the
    github-actions community. Each job is associated with a runner, The runner is a basically a machine
    or a compute engine that can be connected to github . The runner will establish a session and each
    steps in a job will be processed by this runner. The runner works on the steps from top to bottom.
    Steps cannot run in parallel, but jobs can run in parallel(i.e concurrently)

  2.
    - inside your code repo, create a folder called ".github"
    - inside the .github folder, create a folder called: "workflows"
    - inside the workflows folder, here you can create all your github-actions workflows .yaml files

  3.
    the action is used to switch to the branch from where the event that triggered the
    workflow was called from, so if the push_request or pull_request was called from the
    "bug/fix-add-to-cart" branch, this action will switch to the branch, which is the "bug/fix-add-to-cart"
    branch and the sibling steps will run in this specific branch.
    if you do not use the actions/checkout@v4, the job will run on the main branch

  4.
    - On your github actions page, at the top of the terminal where your workflow ran, you'll see
      a button [●●●] at the right corner, click on this button and you'll see a drop-down, this
      drop-down contains the following actions:
          view workflow file
          view workflow runs
          create status badge
          delete all logs

    - click on the settings button for the following options:
      show timestamps
      switch terminal to full-screen
      download logs
      view raw logs

    - click on the [search input] to search for something in your log, let's say in your workflow,
      somewhere you did: echo "stanley will be one of the greatest by GOD'S grace", you can use
      the [search input] to verify that this output is available in your log, and then you can
      also search for other expected outputs from your workflow

    - click on your [Re-run job button] to re-run all your jobs, this button is here because we
      added "workflow_dispatch" to our workflow, otherwise, if it was not present, you'd not
      see this button. the button helps us to run our workflows without always relying on events

  3. what is the | jq '.'? used in the github_action file

    The command | jq '.' is used for processing and formatting JSON data.

    1. | (Pipe Operator) : This takes the output of the command before it (in this case,
      the echo "${{ toJSON(github.event) }}") and sends it as input to the command after the pipe (jq '.')

    2. jq '.' :
      - jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. It allows you to extract, manipulate,
        and format JSON data
      - The "." is a filter in jq that represents the entire JSON object being passed to it.
        Essentially, "." means "take the input and output it as it is."
      - The jq command, when used this way, will pretty-print the JSON data in a more readable format.
        It indents and structures the JSON nicely for easy reading.

    Summary:
      In this case, the entire command echo "${{ toJSON(github.event) }}" | jq '.':
      -
      Converts the GitHub event context (github.event) into a JSON string.
      Pipes that JSON into jq to pretty-print it.
