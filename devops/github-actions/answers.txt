    3. what is the | jq '.'? used in the github_action file

        The command | jq '.' is used for processing and formatting JSON data.

        1. | (Pipe Operator) : This takes the output of the command before it (in this case,
            the echo "${{ toJSON(github.event) }}") and sends it as input to the command after the pipe (jq '.')

        2. jq '.' :
            - jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. It allows you to extract, manipulate,
              and format JSON data
            - The "." is a filter in jq that represents the entire JSON object being passed to it.
              Essentially, "." means "take the input and output it as it is."
            - The jq command, when used this way, will pretty-print the JSON data in a more readable format.
              It indents and structures the JSON nicely for easy reading.

        Summary:
            In this case, the entire command echo "${{ toJSON(github.event) }}" | jq '.':
            -
            Converts the GitHub event context (github.event) into a JSON string.
            Pipes that JSON into jq to pretty-print it.

        1. Automate the build
        2. Introduce Automated test(unit testing, Integration testing)

    4. here is how to set up rules to allow merging based on successful workflows:
        1. Go to your repository on github
        2. click on the "settings" tab
        3. click on the "branches" tab
        4. if no rules, then click on [Add branch ruleset]
        5. Enter your branch name e.g ("main") and then select these options
            [✔] Require a pull request before merging
                [✔] require approvals

            [✔] Require status check to pass before merging
                [✔] Require branches to be up to date before merging
                input [search for status check]
                - In the search box, enter the name of the job you want to pass before the 
                  "incoming branch" is allowed to merge into the "protected branch"
                  (i.e the branch you specified @ step-4, the "main" branch)
                - {
                    The teacher added 3 jobs, these jobs can be found in different jobs at different workflow:
                    - Run linter            {see ./ci-cd-intro/.github/workflows/ci.yml}
                    - Run unit tests        {see ./ci-cd-intro/.github/workflows/ci.yml}
                    - Analyze (javascript)  {see ./ci-cd-intro/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml}
                }

6. reusable workflows
    - what are reusable workflows
        GitHub Actions reusable workflows allow you to create workflows that can be shared and reused
        across different repositories, it can also be used across different workflows within the same
        repository. This feature helps to reduce duplication and increase maintainability by
        centralizing commonly used workflows, making it easier to update and manage them.

        - Reusable workflows can accept inputs, and return outputs, which allows for customization
          and better interaction between workflows.

        - A reusable workflow is just a normal GitHub Actions workflow, but it needs to be designed
          to be reused. It is typically stored in a `.github/workflows/` folder.

    - Read: best practice for reusable workflows
        1. Modularization: Break down workflows into smaller, reusable components. For example, you could
            create separate reusable workflows for tasks like linting, testing, or deploying.

        2. Parameterization: Use inputs and outputs to customize reusable workflows for different scenarios

        3. Versioning: Tag your workflows with a version (e.g., `v1.0.0`) to avoid breaking changes when
            reusing them.

        4. Security: Handle secrets carefully and make sure you only pass secrets when required
