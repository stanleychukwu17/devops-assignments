    - what are reusable workflows
        GitHub Actions reusable workflows allow you to create workflows that can be shared and reused
        across different repositories, it can also be used across different workflows within the same
        repository. This feature helps to reduce duplication and increase maintainability by
        centralizing commonly used workflows, making it easier to update and manage them.

        - Reusable workflows can accept inputs, and return outputs, which allows for customization
          and better interaction between workflows.

        - A reusable workflow is just a normal GitHub Actions workflow, but it needs to be designed
          to be reused. It is typically stored in a `.github/workflows/` folder.

    - Read: best practice for reusable workflows
        1. Modularization: Break down workflows into smaller, reusable components. For example, you could
            create separate reusable workflows for tasks like linting, testing, or deploying.

        2. Parameterization: Use inputs and outputs to customize reusable workflows for different scenarios

        3. Versioning: Tag your workflows with a version (e.g., `v1.0.0`) to avoid breaking changes when
            reusing them.

        4. Security: Handle secrets carefully and make sure you only pass secrets when required
