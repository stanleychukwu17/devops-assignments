4.  you can represent a string by
    1. just writing it out : like this string
    2. by wrapping them in double quotes : "like this string"
    2. by wrapping them in single quotes : 'like this string'

5. You use a pound sign (#) to indicate a comment, and in can appear on its own or inline e.g
    # this is a full line comment
    foo: bar # this is an inline comment

6. these are strings in multiple lines using 3 methods
    1. bar: "this is a string \n it spans multiple lines \n and we love it"
    2  bar: > this is a string
        it spans multiple lines
        but it is displayed in one line
    3. bar: | this is a string
        it spans multiple lines
        and it is displayed in multiple lines

8. you represent a null in yaml using 3 symbols..

9. you can represent an array in 2 ways, and they are:
    1. numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    2. numbers:
        - 1
        - 2
        - 3
        - 4

10. items:
        things:
            - name1: huey
              name2: dewey
              name3: louie

    2. numbers:
            one: 1
            two: 2
            three: 3

12. chomp modifiers are used to tell yaml what we would like to happen with multiline text that
    ends with [space] or [tab], by default sometimes, yaml strips/removes this [space]/[tab]
    from the end of the text, but we can use chomp modifiers to explicitly tell yaml what to do.
    we use + symbol to tell yaml to preserve the end as it is
    we use - symbol to tell yaml to remove the characters from the end of our text.
    
    So we can do: >+ or |+
    and also, we can do: >- or |-

13. Answers:
    Note: >+ this is a multiline text,
            but will be displayed as a one line text
            and the end [space] will be preserved 

    Note: |- this is a multiline text
            and will be displayed as a multiline text
            and the end [tab] will be stripped away
