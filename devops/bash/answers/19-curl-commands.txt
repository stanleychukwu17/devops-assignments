Here are the most useful and commonly used curl flags in Linux, organized by category, with
practical examples.

# Basic Requests
  :: -X, --request: Specify HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), default is GET if -X is not specified
    e.g: curl -X POST https://example.com

  :: -I, --head: Fetch only headers (HEAD request)
    e.g: curl -I https://httpbin.org/get
    result might look like:
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
      Content-Length: 12345
      Last-Modified: Wed, 21 Jan 2020 14:30:00 GMT
      ETag: "1234567890abcdef"
      Accept-Ranges: bytes
      Server: Apache
      Date: Thu, 04 Dec 2024 00:00:00 GMT
      ---
      The actual headers will vary depending on the server and resource being requested.

  :: -d, --data: Send data in POST request (URL-encoded)
    e.g: curl -X POST -d "name=john&age=30" https://httpbin.org/post

  :: --json: sends json data to the specified url, there are 2 methods to do this:
    1. -H to set header and -d to add the json data
      e.g: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{"key":"value"}"  https://api.example.com
      -
      This is the classic, widely compatible method.
    
    2. Modern Method: --json (curl 7.82+)
      curl --json '{"name":"stanley"}' https://api.example.com/resource
      -
      The --json is a convenience feature introduced in recent versions of curl (v7.82.0+, released in 2022)


# Output & Saving
  :: -o, --output: Save response to file
      e.g: curl -o webpage.html https://example.com

  :: --output-dir: Save to specific directory (curl 7.73+)
      e.g: curl --output-dir /tmp -o file.html https://example.com

  :: -s, --silent: It tells curl to mute the progress meter and most error messages during the operation, The command
                   only outputs the requested data (e.g., the HTML content) to standard output
      e.g: curl -s https://api.ipify.org

  :: -S: Show errors, This flag only has an effect when combined with -s. It tells curl that if an error occurs,
         it should override the silent setting (-s) and print the error message to standard error.
         The result is you get silence on success & get feedback on failure.
      e.g: curl -sS https://example.com

  :: -f, --fail: It instructs curl to fail silently on server errors like 4xx (Client Error) or 5xx (Server Error).
                HTTP response codes. If a server returns an HTTP error, curl will exit with a non-zero exit code,
                which is essential for script logic, otherwise curl would download the error page and exit with a
                success code (0)
      e.g: curl -f https://example.com/badpage
      popular combos:
      curl -fsSL https://example.com/badpage, i.e fail silently, show minimal errors, follow redirection


# Headers & Authentication
  :: -H, --header: Add custom header
        e.g: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123" https://example.com
  
  :: -u, --user: Basic auth (user:password)
      e.g: curl -u user:pass https://example.com

  :: -b, --cookie: Send cookies
      e.g: curl -b "session=abc123" url
