{
    Tip: the docker container name is the same as the hostname if you do not provide a hostname
    if you do:
        docker run -p 80:80 --name nginx_container -d nginx:1.26.3
        the container name & hostname too will be nginx_container

    but if you can provide a custom hostname by doing:
        docker run -p 80:80 --name nginx_container --hostname nginx_load_balancer -d nginx:1.26.3
        now the container will be: nginx_container
        now the hostname will be: nginx_load_balancer
}
3.  Nginx Docker container
    - Look at the image of the 2 nginx load balancers we will be creating
    - start a nginx container using
        image: nginx:1.26.3
        container_name: nginx
        port 80:80
    - inspect the container
    - see the logs from the container
    - attach to the container
    - login into the container and see what it looks like
