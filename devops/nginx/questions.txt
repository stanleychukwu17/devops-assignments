SECTION 1
=============
1.  Nginx
    - what is Nginx
    - talk about what a normal architecture look like vs what an Nginx architecture would look like
    - what are the following concepts/terms in Nginx? {Frontend, Backend, Upstream, Downstream}
    - Tell us about the 7 layers in OSI Model

2.  Talk about Layer 4 and Layer 7 proxying in Nginx (give examples for each)

3.  Talk about TLS termination and TLS passthrough in Nginx

4.0 practice {
    practice-project: 
        local: D:\Sz - projects\0-practice\devops\nginx\1-simple-nginx-docker-nodeapp
        github: https://github.com/stanleychukwu17/0-practice-to-become-better/tree/main/devops/nginx/1-nodeapp-simple
        template: https://github.com/stanleychukwu17/hussien-nasser-introduction-to-nginx-project-1
    -
    - check start the app to see that all is working properly
    - write the Dockerfile for the app
    - create an image for the Dockerfile you built - "simple_nodeapp:v1"
    - start a container with the image: "simple_nodeapp:v1", to be sure it works
    - start the 3 docker containers and be sure everything is working fine
    - write the Nginx configuration and start the Nginx container, there will be error because of
      service discovery, you need to connect all services to the same network
    - Do yo thing with the networking {
        create a new network nginx_network
        connect the network to the containers
        inspect one of the containers to be sure that it is in the nginx_network
    }
    - restart the app to see it is working with nginx {
        see the logs of nginx_0 container, check to find the 404 error when a request
        was made for the favicon.ico
    }
    - write everything in a docker-compose file
    - start the docker-compose and be sure it works
    - delete {
        Dockerfile
        docker-compose.yml
        nginx.conf
        Docker images
        Docker containers
        Docker network
        -
        delete all files except app.js .gitignore .dockerignore
    }
}

6. Read or explain the code in your nginx config

7 Read about exposing ports of your docker container

8. Another task: write another nginx.conf configuration
    - write 2 upstreams (app1_backend, app2_backend)
    - let these upstreams group have 2 containers each, let app1 listen on port 9000, and app2 on 8000
    - create 2 servers
    - let the 1st server listen on port 81 with server_name app1.stanley.com and forward
      all request to app1_backend
    - let the 2nd server listen on port 82 with server_name app2.stanley.com and forward
      all request to app2_backend
    - create the 3rd server to listen on port 80 with server_name static.stanley.com and
      let it serve files from the root

9. Understanding nginx timeouts for efficient configuration
    - Read: see list of frontend & backend timeouts
    - Read: see explanation of frontend timeouts
    - Read: see explanation of backend timeouts

10. Nginx as a layer 7 proxy, look at the example, explain what is going on and re-write it

11. Nginx as a layer 4 proxy, look at the example, explain it and re-write it

12. Enable HTTPS on Nginx
    - Read: how do you enable https on your nginx server
    - enable fast and secure TLS 1.2 & TLS 1.3 on Nginx
    - enable http2 on Nginx

13 if you have time, Read: the difference between HTTP/1 and HTTP/2

## Websockets with Nginx
14. practice
    Follow the README.md to solve the problems for each of the projects:
    1. nginx and websockets | live mouse movement app
        https://github.com/stanleychukwu17/0-practice-to-become-better/tree/main/devops/nginx/2-nginx-websocket-mouse-app
        D:\Sz - projects\0-practice\devops\nginx\2-nginx-websocket-mouse-app

    2. nginx and websocket chat app
        https://github.com/stanleychukwu17/0-practice-to-become-better/tree/main/devops/nginx/3-nginx-websocket-chat-app
        D:\Sz - projects\0-practice\devops\nginx\3-nginx-websocket-chat-app

15. - see what layer 4 proxying for nginx and websocket looks like
    - read some of the explanation
