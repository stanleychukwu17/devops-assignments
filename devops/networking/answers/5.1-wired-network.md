In a **wired network**, devices communicate with each other by using physical cables (usually **Ethernet cables**) and network devices like **switches** or **routers** to manage traffic. The process is much more straightforward than in a wireless network because it relies on physical connections to transmit data.

Here’s how devices communicate in a typical wired network:

### 1. **Physical Connections**:
   - **Ethernet Cables**: Most wired networks use **Ethernet cables** (such as Cat5e, Cat6) to connect devices to the network. These cables carry data signals between devices.
   - Devices (computers, printers, servers, etc.) are connected to a **network switch** or a **router** through Ethernet cables.

### 2. **Network Switches**:
   - A **switch** is the central device that helps devices within a local area network (LAN) communicate with each other. It has multiple ports, and devices are connected to these ports using Ethernet cables.
   - When one device wants to communicate with another, it sends data through the switch. The switch keeps track of which device is connected to which port and forwards data only to the correct destination device. This makes communication faster and more efficient.
   - The switch essentially “switches” data between devices within the same network.

### 3. **Routers**:
   - A **router** is a device that routes traffic between different networks, like between a local network (LAN) and the internet (WAN). It may also assign IP addresses to devices in the network (if it has a DHCP server).
   - If a device wants to communicate with a device outside its local network (like accessing a website), the router forwards the request to the correct destination and then routes the response back to the requesting device.
   - Routers manage traffic between the local network (your home or office network) and the external network (the internet).

### 4. **Data Communication**:
   - Devices communicate using a set of standardized protocols like **TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).
   - When a device sends data, it creates a **data packet**. This packet contains:
     - **Source IP address**: The address of the device sending the data.
     - **Destination IP address**: The address of the device receiving the data.
     - **Data**: The actual message or information being sent.
   - The switch or router forwards these data packets to the correct device by reading the **MAC addresses** (Media Access Control addresses) or IP addresses in the packet.
   
### 5. **MAC Address**:
   - Each device on a wired network has a unique **MAC address**, which is used to identify it at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. 
   - When a device sends data, the MAC address helps the switch know where to send the data within the local network.

### 6. **Communication Process**:
   - **Sending Data**: When Device A (e.g., a computer) wants to send data to Device B (e.g., a printer), it will:
     - Create a data packet with the destination device's address.
     - Send it over the Ethernet cable to the switch.
     - The switch reads the destination MAC address, finds the correct port, and forwards the packet to Device B.
   - **Receiving Data**: Device B will receive the packet and interpret the data, sending a response if needed.

### 7. **Network Layers**:
   - Devices in a wired network communicate using the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which breaks down network communication into seven layers (from physical to application). The key layers in wired communication are:
     - **Physical Layer**: This is where the Ethernet cables and hardware (like switches and routers) operate.
     - **Data Link Layer**: This layer handles MAC addresses and ensures data is correctly framed for delivery.
     - **Network Layer**: This layer is responsible for IP addressing and routing data between devices across networks.
     - **Transport Layer**: This layer ensures data is delivered reliably using protocols like TCP.

### 8. **Collision Domain and Broadcast Domain**:
   - **Collision Domain**: In older networks with hubs (before switches were widely used), multiple devices shared the same communication channel, which could lead to data collisions (two devices sending data at the same time). Switches reduce this problem by creating separate collision domains for each port.
   - **Broadcast Domain**: A **broadcast domain** is a logical area of the network in which a broadcast message sent by one device is received by all devices. Routers typically separate broadcast domains, while switches do not.

### Summary:
In a wired network:
- Devices are physically connected using Ethernet cables.
- **Switches** handle communication between devices on the same local network (LAN).
- **Routers** handle traffic between different networks (e.g., your local network and the internet).
- Devices communicate by sending data packets that are routed based on MAC and IP addresses.
- Communication is reliable, with data sent in a structured way using networking protocols (like TCP/IP) to ensure delivery.

By using physical cables and switches/routers, wired networks typically provide more stable, faster, and more reliable communication compared to wireless networks.
