1. What is a network
    A network is multiple devices been connected to each other so they can communicate with each other.
    The devices often need some network equipment to connect them all together and help direct the flow
    of traffic. Common networking equipments are switches and routers

    - In a wired LAN network:
      The most common way for devices to be connected to each other is by using a switch
    - In a wireless LAN network:
      The most common way for devices to be connected is through an AP(Access Point) & a router, but
      most of the modern routers usually comes with in-built AP

2. What is a LAN and a WAN
    - LAN:
      LAN (Local area network) is a network of computers and devices that are connected within a small
      geographical area, like a home, office or school. it allows devices to communicate with each other
      and share resources like files, printers or internet Access
      e.g: Home Network, Office Network, School Network e.t.c.

    - WAN:
      WAN (Wide area network) is a much larger network that covers a broader geographical area, often
      spanning cities, countries or even continents. The internet is the largest example of a WAN. it
      connects multiple LANs and other networks together, enabling communication over long distances
      e.g:
      - The Internet: The most common example of a WAN. It connects millions of LANs worldwide.

      - Corporate Networks: A large company with offices in multiple cities or countries might have a WAN
        connecting all its local office networks (LANs) to each other for communication and data sharing.

      - Telecommunications Networks: Mobile network providers like AT&T or Verizon have WANs to connect their
        base stations and provide service across large areas or even globally.

3. what is a protocol
    A protocol is a set of rules & guides that governs how data is transmitted over a network.
    These rules dictate how devices communicate with each other, how data is formatted,
    and how errors are handled, among other things. Here are a few common ones:

    1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
        Used for transferring web pages and other content on the internet.

    2. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):
        It's a set of rules that helps data travel across the internet. It breaks down data into packets,
        sends them across the network, and makes sure they all arrive in the right order.
        Think of it as the system that gets data from one place to another.

    3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol): for transferring files between computers over a network.

    4. DNS (Domain Name System):
        Translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers
        can understand.

    5. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending emails between servers.

    Each of these protocols works in a very specific way to ensure data is sent, received, and understood
    correctly by the devices on either end of the communication.

3.1 Read: About TCP/IP and HTTP
  HTTP & TCP/IP works together, here is how:

  - TCP/IP is the foundation for internet communication. It handles how data is transmitted and ensures
    it gets from one device to another correctly

    - TCP/IP is at Layer 4 (the Transport Layer) and Layer 3 (the Network Layer) of the OSI model:

    - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) works at the Transport Layer (Layer 4), ensuring reliable
      data transfer between devices.

    - IP (Internet Protocol) works at the Network Layer (Layer 3), responsible for routing data packets
      across different networks.


  - HTTP operates on top of TCP/IP. it is like a class that inherits from TCP/IP as it's parent class.
    It uses the reliable data transmission provided by TCP/IP to send and receive web page requests
    and responses

    HTTP is at Layer 7 (the Application Layer): It deals directly with user interactions,
    such as requesting web pages. HTTP defines how web browsers and web servers communicate.
  
  So, when you visit a website, HTTP is the protocol that manages the request and response for the
  web pages, but TCP/IP makes sure that data travels across the internet reliably, without getting lost
  or mixed up. Both are essential for web browsing to work properly

4. Difference btw a wired and a wireless network
    - Wired networks: Uses physical cables (like Ethernet cables) to connect devices.
      they are faster, more reliable, and secure, but less flexible.

    - Wireless networks: Uses radio waves to connect devices without physical cables (typically via Wi-Fi).
      they are more convenient and flexible, though they may offer slightly slower and
      less reliable performance.

5.
  1. how does a wired network communicate
    In a **wired network**, devices communicate with each other by using physical cables
    (usually **Ethernet cables**) and network devices like **switches** or **routers** to manage traffic.

    In a wired network:
    - Devices are physically connected using Ethernet cables.
    - **Switches** handle communication between devices on the same local network (LAN).
    - **Routers** handle traffic between different networks (e.g., your local network and the internet).
    - Devices communicate by sending data packets that are routed based on MAC and IP addresses.

  2. how does a wireless network communicate
    In a **wireless network**, devices communicate using **radio waves** to send and receive data.

    The **Access Point (AP)** acts as a bridge between the wireless devices.

    Devices send data packets over the air, using wireless standards like Wi-Fi, and communicate through
    protocols like TCP/IP to ensure data reaches its destination.

    ### Example of Communication:
    1. **Laptop Wants to Browse the Web**:
    - Your laptop sends a request to the AP (router) to access a webpage.
    - The AP forwards the request to the router, which then communicates with the internet to fetch the webpage.
    - The router sends the webpage data back to the AP, which then transmits it to your laptop via radio waves.

6. Network Addresses
  - What is a MAC Address & IP Address
    - MAC address:
      A MAC address is an address that is assigned to a device when the device is manufactured.

      A device might contain multiple network cards and each of these network cards have it's
      own MAC address. so if a device have multiple network cards, it will also have multiple
      mac-addresses. Since a mac-address is assigned when the device is manufactured, the
      mac address of a device cannot be changed

    - IP address:
      Every device connected to a network usually has an IP address, but this address is
      assigned by the DHCP in the router
      here is how it works {
        Devices get an IP address when connected to a network through a process called
        **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**. Here's how it works:

        1. Device Requests an IP Address: When a device (like a computer or smartphone) connects to a network,
          it first sends out a request to get an IP address. This request is sent to the DHCP server,
          which is usually part of the router or dedicated server on the network.

        2. DHCP Discovery: The device sends a DHCP Discover message, which is a broadcast to all devices
          on the network asking for an IP address.

        3. DHCP Offer: The DHCP server receives the request and responds with a DHCP Offer message.
          This message includes an available IP address and other network settings
          (like the subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers).

        4. DHCP Request: The device receives the DHCP offer and responds with a DHCP Request message,
          indicating that it wants to use the provided IP address.

        5. DHCP Acknowledgment: Finally, the DHCP server sends an acknowledgment (DHCP Ack) to the device,
          confirming the IP address has been assigned.

        Alternatively, if a static IP configuration is used, the device is manually assigned an
        IP address by a network administrator or set directly on the device. 
      }

7. OSI Model Network
  - What are the 7 layers of the OSI model: use "Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away"
    Application - Away - Layer 7
    Presentation - Pizza - Layer 6
    Session - Sausage - Layer 5
    Transport - Throw - Layer 4
    Network - Not - Layer 3
    Data Link - Do - Layer 2
    Physical Layer - Please - Layer 1

    Upper layer = [Application, Presentation, Session]
    Lower layer = [Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical Layer]

  - Explain each of the layers
    - Application Layer: this layer covers how your Application access the network (GUI), it includes
      stuffs like web browsing, checking emails, uploading & downloading of files e.t.c
    
    - Presentation Layer: this layer converts the data been sent into a format that other layers
      and the receiving device can understand

    - Session Layer: your Application might be talking to different endpoints, this layer creates
      a session btw your device and these endpoints

    - Transport Layer: this layer is responsible for ensuring that data is transferred reliably between
      devices over a network. It takes care of breaking data into smaller pieces (called segments),
      and it makes sure those pieces are sent, received, and reassembled correctly.

      Protocols at this layer:
      - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data.
      - UDP (User DataGram Protocol): Provides faster but less reliable data transfer. Itâ€™s used 
        for things like video streaming where speed is more important than ensuring every packet arrives
        perfectly.

    - Network Layer: It handles routing and addressing to ensure that data reaches the correct destination,
      even if it needs to pass through multiple networks.
      This layer attaches the source i.p address and the destination i.p address to the header of
      each segments

      Protocols at this layer:
      - IP (Internet Protocol): The most important protocol at this layer, responsible for addressing
        and routing data across networks. There are two main versions: IPv4 and IPv6.
      - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Used for diagnostic purposes, like sending "ping"
        requests to check if a device is reachable.

    - Data Link Layer: this layer attaches the mac addresses of the source and destination devices
      now our segments will look like:
      segments = [
        header = [
          mac addresses
          i.p addresses
          port numbers
        ]
        data = [msg]
      ]

      Common Protocols at the Data Link Layer: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)

    - Physical layer: this layer is responsible for encoding the data into physical signals
      it converts data into signals (electrical, light, or radio waves) and transmitting those
      signals over a physical medium like copper cables, fiber-optic cables, or air (for wireless connections)
      The bits themselves are transmitted as electrical pulses, light signals, or radio waves.

      Common Technologies and Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Fiber-Optic Communication, Bluetooth
