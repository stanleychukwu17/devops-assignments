1. What is a network
    A network multiple devices been connected to each other so they can communicate with each other.
    - In a wired LAN network:
      The most common way for devices to be connected to each other is by using a switch
    - In a wireless LAN network:
      The most common way for devices to be connected is through an AP(Access Point) & a router, but most
      of the modern routers usually comes with in-built AP

    - What is a LAN and a WAN
      - LAN:
        LAN (Local area network) is a network of computers and devices that are connected within a small
        geographical area, like a home, office or school. it allows devices to communicate with each other
        and share resources like files, printers or internet Access
        e.g:
        - Home Network: The network you set up in your house, connecting your devices like computers,
          smartphones, smart TVs, printers, etc.

        - Office Network: In a workplace, all the computers, printers, and servers connected within the office
          to share resources and communicate.

        - School Network: In a school, the computers in different classrooms, the library, and the admin offices
          connected together to share files, access the internet, and more.

      - WAN:
        WAN (Wide area network) is a much larger network that covers a broader geographical area, often
        spanning cities, countries or even continents. The internet is the largest example of a WAN. it connects
        multiple LANs and other networks together, enabling communication over long distances
        e.g:
        - The Internet: The most common example of a WAN. It connects millions of LANs worldwide.

        - Corporate Networks: A large company with offices in multiple cities or countries might have a WAN
          connecting all its local office networks (LANs) to each other for communication and data sharing.

        - Telecommunications Networks: Mobile network providers like AT&T or Verizon have WANs to connect their
          base stations and provide service across large areas or even globally.
