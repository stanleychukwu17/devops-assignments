1. What is a network
    A network is multiple devices been connected to each other so they can communicate with each other.
    The devices often need some network equipment to connect them all together and help direct the flow
    of traffic. Common networking equipments are switches and routers

    - In a wired LAN network:
      The most common way for devices to be connected to each other is by using a switch
    - In a wireless LAN network:
      The most common way for devices to be connected is through an AP(Access Point) & a router, but
      most of the modern routers usually comes with in-built AP

2. What is a LAN and a WAN
    - LAN:
      LAN (Local area network) is a network of computers and devices that are connected within a small
      geographical area, like a home, office or school. it allows devices to communicate with each other
      and share resources like files, printers or internet Access
      e.g: Home Network, Office Network, School Network e.t.c.

    - WAN:
      WAN (Wide area network) is a much larger network that covers a broader geographical area, often
      spanning cities, countries or even continents. The internet is the largest example of a WAN. it connects
      multiple LANs and other networks together, enabling communication over long distances
      e.g:
      - The Internet: The most common example of a WAN. It connects millions of LANs worldwide.

      - Corporate Networks: A large company with offices in multiple cities or countries might have a WAN
        connecting all its local office networks (LANs) to each other for communication and data sharing.

      - Telecommunications Networks: Mobile network providers like AT&T or Verizon have WANs to connect their
        base stations and provide service across large areas or even globally.

3. what is a protocol
    A protocol is a set of rules & guides that governs how data is transmitted over a network.
    These rules dictate how devices communicate with each other, how data is formatted,
    and how errors are handled, among other things.

    There are many different types of network protocols with specific purposes. Here are a few common ones:

    1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
        Used for transferring web pages and other content on the internet.
    
    2. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):
        A suite of protocols that forms the backbone of the internet. It governs how data packets are transmitted
        across networks.

    3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol):
        Used for transferring files between computers over a network. It's often used for uploading or downloading
        files from a server.

    4. DNS (Domain Name System):
        Translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers
        can understand.

    5. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):
        Used for sending emails between servers.

    6. IMAP/POP3:
        These protocols are used for receiving and retrieving emails from a server
        (IMAP allows syncing across devices, POP3 downloads the email to a single device)

    Each of these protocols works in a very specific way to ensure data is sent, received, and understood
    correctly by the devices on either end of the communication.

4. Difference btw a wired and a wireless network
    - Wired networks: Uses physical cables (like Ethernet cables) to connect devices.
      they are faster, more reliable, and secure, but less flexible.

    - Wireless networks: Uses radio waves to connect devices without physical cables (typically via Wi-Fi).
      they are more convenient and flexible, though they may offer slightly slower and less reliable performance.

    Read more {
        Wired Network:
        - Speed: Typically offers faster speeds and more stable connections compared to wireless networks,
          as the signal doesn't degrade over distance or face interference.
        - Reliability: More reliable because there’s no signal interference from things like walls or other
          electronic devices.
        - Security: Tends to be more secure because physical access to the cables is required to intercept data.
        - Setup: Can be more complex due to the need to run cables, especially in larger spaces.
        - Flexibility: Less flexible, as devices are tied to a specific location because of the cables.

        Wireless Network:
        - Speed: Can be slower and more prone to fluctuations due to interference
          (e.g., from walls, other electronics, or even distance from the router).
        - Reliability: More susceptible to signal interference or weak connections, especially over
          longer distances or in crowded environments.
        - Security: Generally less secure than wired networks, but this can be mitigated with strong
          encryption and security protocols (like WPA3).
        - Setup: Easier to set up, with fewer physical constraints since you don’t need to run cables.
        - Flexibility: Highly flexible, allowing devices to connect from virtually anywhere within
          range of the Wi-Fi signal.

5. 1. how does a wired network communicate
    In a **wired network**, devices communicate with each other by using physical cables
    (usually **Ethernet cables**) and network devices like **switches** or **routers** to manage traffic.
    The process is much more straightforward than in a wireless network because it relies on physical
    connections to transmit data.

    In a wired network:
    - Devices are physically connected using Ethernet cables.
    - **Switches** handle communication between devices on the same local network (LAN).
    - **Routers** handle traffic between different networks (e.g., your local network and the internet).
    - Devices communicate by sending data packets that are routed based on MAC and IP addresses.
    - Communication is reliable, with data sent in a structured way using networking protocols (like TCP/IP) to ensure delivery.

    By using physical cables and switches/routers, wired networks typically provide more stable, faster, and more reliable communication compared to wireless networks.

    Here’s how devices communicate in a typical wired network:

   2. how does a wireless network communicate
    In a **wireless network**, devices communicate without the need for physical cables, using **radio waves**
    to send and receive data.

    In a **wireless network**, devices communicate using radio waves to send and receive data.
    The **Access Point (AP)** acts as a bridge between the wireless devices and the wired network,
    enabling devices to connect without physical cables.
    Devices send data packets over the air, using wireless standards like Wi-Fi, and communicate through
    protocols like TCP/IP to ensure data reaches its destination. Security measures like encryption and
    authentication protect the integrity of the communication.

    ### Example of Communication:
    1. **Laptop Wants to Browse the Web**:
    - Your laptop sends a request to the AP (router) to access a webpage.
    - The AP forwards the request to the router, which then communicates with the internet to fetch the webpage.
    - The router sends the webpage data back to the AP, which then transmits it to your laptop via radio waves.
    
    2. **Streaming a Video**:
    - You start streaming a video on your smartphone.
    - The phone sends data packets to the AP requesting the video stream.
    - The AP forwards the request to the router, which fetches the stream from the server.
    - The server sends the video data to the router, which forwards it back to the AP, and the AP sends it to your phone.
    - Your phone decodes the video data and displays it on the screen.
