NOTE: you can download git kraken, has a great ui for managing git messages and commit history
    and all so for seeing the difference clearly when resolving merge conflicts

1.  - Config default user.name & user.email
    - how do you see the global user.name and user.email
    - how do you add a local user.name & user.email

2.  - how to see all commit messages in a repo
    - then how to see it in one-line

3.  - How do you modify commits to include files you did not add + modify the commit message
    - No we, use "git commit -m" for simple oneline commit message, what if you want to write a more detailed
      multi-line commit, what command will you use
{i need to add from my note how to setup vsCode or any other code editor to be the default editor for git commit --amend or git commit}

4.  - Tell us about github branches
    - Create a new branch
    - Delete a branch
    - rename a branch
    - See all the branches locally
    - see all branches with their last commit messages
    - See all remote branches
    - See all remote and local branches at once

5.  - Switch to a newly created branch
    - Switch while creating a new branch using the *Switch* command

6. what happens when you try to Switch from one branch to another (
    1. and the current branch has un-committed changes
    2. new files created that are not saved & un-committed
)

7. if your current branch is the "bug/fix-cart" branch, how do you merge this branch into the main branch

8. how do you save an uncompleted, uncommitted work before switching to another branch

9. Tell us all about the commands of stash and explain them (6 commands)

10. how do you take just a file back to an old commit (i.e losing the changes made after the commit)

11. what is the difference btw git reset and git revert

12. how do you clone a project from github into your working directory

13. what is git remote and *git remote -v*

14. - how do you add a remote url to push your github code to (also the syntax)
    - how do you delete a remote url

15. - write down the full syntax for git push
    - how do you push a feature branch, e.g push "bug/fix-add-to-cart-btn"
    - how do you set a branch to be an upstream branch to always push to

16. how do you switch to a remote branch (i.e a branch available in your remote repo,
    but not in your local repo)

17. Diff btw *git fetch* and *git pull*

18. - write a command to fetch from origin/main branch
    - write another command to fetch from origin/new-page/promo

19. - write a command to pull from origin/main branch
    - write another command to pull from origin/new-page/promo
    - what happens when you do a git pull, especially if they are conflicts

20. cleaning up
    - write a command to clean up only remote tracking branches (without pulling)
    - write a command to clean up both your working space & remote tracking branches (you have to pull)




tips {
    you can do: git commit /src/component {
        instead of:
            git add /src/component
            git commit -m "....."
    }
}
