Framer-motion & motion have been merged together:
here is a guide on upgrading:
https://motion.dev/docs/upgrade-guide
if you upgrade, the new motion currently supports all the hooks and methods from framer-motion

motion is quite different from framer-motion, so i'll be sticking with framer-motion for
the foreseeable future, no time now to start learning motion after all the time i already
invested in framer-motion

*failed questions
6,


1. Talk about useMotionValue
    - List some of the useMotionValue methods (7 methods)

2. use the useMotionValue and useTransform on a drag element,
    - let the opacity of the element change as it is been dragged

3. use the useTransform hook to transform the xInput -> opacityOutput & colorOutput
    where: xInput = [-100, 0, 100]

4. Tell us about useMotionTemplate and give an example of how to use it
    - example1: use it to transform an element, translate the element on the x & y axis
    - example2: use it to change the drop shadow of an element

5. Tell us about useScroll and give an example of how to use it to display page scroll progress bar
6. How can you track the scrolling in a scrollable element using the useScroll hook
    (track scroll in x-axis)
7. How do you track the scroll progress on an element that is not scrollable
    (i.e the scroll progress of an element as it enters and leaves the viewport)
    - explain the offset option provided
7.1 Use the example from question 7 and expand on it
    - change the opacity of the element using useTransform, change from 0 to 1
      (i.e fading in the div as it enters the web-page)

8. Explain the useSpring hook and give an example
    - explain some of the options that can be passed into a useSpring hook

9. Tell us about the useTransform hook and give us an example
    - show some examples of using functions to transform the input value

10. - Tell us about the useVelocity hook,
    - create a motion value for "x", let the initial value be 0
    - use useSpring to smoothen the movement of the "x" value
    - use the velocity hook to track the returned smoothen value
    - use the returned velocity value to scale an element using the useTransform hook
      input: [-3000, 0 ,3000], output: [2,1,2]
    - use the returned velocity value to change the backgroundColor
    - use all returned value on the element, give the element a drag prop

----------

11. Talk about the useAnimationControls hook and give examples
11.1 how do you use variant variables in useAnimationControls
11.2 useAnimationControls for sequence animations, show an example of using sequence to open a menu
11.3 using dynamic element with useAnimationControls.start
11.4 Talk about the useAnimationControls methods, the .set(), .start(), .stop()

12. Talk about useAnimationFrame hook and give us an example

13. Talk about the useInView hook
    - what are the options that can be provided to this hook

14. Talk about keyframe's in framer-motion, also how do you space them using times

15. List at-least 5 gesture animation props
    - talk about whileHover
    - talk about whileTap

16. Talk about Layout animations
    - customizing layout animation duration
    - talk about layout scroll prop

17. - Drag, what values can the drag prop receive
    - talk about whileDrag
    - talk about dragSnapToOrigin
    - talk about dragConstraints
    - talk about dragElastic
    - talk about dragMomentum
    - talk about dragPropagation
    - talk about dragTransition
    - talk about onDrag, onDragStart, onDragEnd, onDirectionLock

17.1
    - talk about useDragControls
    - talk about dragListener
    - what do you do on touch-screen devices when using useDragControls?


18. tell us about these transition properties {when, delayChildren, staggerChildren, staggerDirection}
    - talk about dynamic variant

19. - Talk about useAnimate hook
    - what can it be used for
    - use the useAnimate & usePresence hooks to animate a component when it exits the dom

20. Talk about event propagation(i.e bubbling up of an event)
    talk about the whileInView animation
        - using with variants
        - using with definitionObjects
        - using viewport, customize the item so that whileInView will work only when visible inside
            the scrollable container & and only when 20% is visible

----------
21. transitions
    - List 3 types of transition
    - Types of built-in named easing functions
    - How do you ease with cubic-beiZer
    - How do you specify different easing functions for different "times" for different "keyframe" values
    - How do you repeat an animation + specify a repeat type & specifying a delay for the repeat

22. Read the answer - on supported values

23. Transform origin
    - how do you set origin of x,y,z axis (use number and text)
    - what properties do you animate when animating an svg
