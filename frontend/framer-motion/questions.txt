Framer-motion & motion have been merged together:
here is a guide on upgrading:
https://motion.dev/docs/upgrade-guide
if you upgrade, the new motion currently supports all the hooks and methods from framer-motion

motion is quite different from framer-motion, so i'll be sticking with framer-motion for
the foreseeable future, no time now to start learning motion after all the time i already
invested in framer-motion

https://motion.dev/docs/react-three-fiber


1. Talk about useMotionValue
    - List some of the useMotionValue methods (7 methods)

2. use the useMotionValue and useTransform on a drag element,
    - let the opacity of the element change as it is been dragged

3. use the useTransform hook to transform the xInput -> opacityOutput & colorOutput
    where: xInput = [-100, 0, 100]

4. Tell us about useMotionTemplate and give an example of how to use it
    - example1: use it to transform an element, translate the element on the x & y axis
    - example2: use it to change the drop shadow of an element

5. Tell us about useScroll
    - give an example of updating a progress bar using the scroll progress of a web page
6. How can you track the scrolling in a scrollable element using the useScroll hook
    (track scroll in x-axis)
7. How do you track the scroll progress on an element that is not scrollable
    (i.e the scroll progress of an element as it enters and leaves the viewport)
    - explain the offset option provided
7.1 Use the example from question 7 and expand on it
    - change the opacity of the element using useTransform, change from 0 to 1
      (i.e fading in the div as it enters the web-page)

8. Explain the useSpring hook and give an example
    - explain some of the options that can be passed into a useSpring hook

9. Tell us about the useTransform hook and give us an example
    - show some examples of using functions to transform the input value

10. - Tell us about the useVelocity hook
    - create a motion value for "x", let the initial value be 0
    - use useSpring to smoothen the movement of the "x" value
    - use the velocity hook to track the returned smoothen value
    - use the returned velocity value to scale an element using the useTransform hook
      input: [-3000, 0 ,3000], output: [2,1,2], clamp: false
    - use the returned velocity value to change the backgroundColor
    - use all returned value on the element, give the element a drag prop

----------

11. Talk about the useAnimationControls hook and give examples
11.1 how do you use variant variables in useAnimationControls
11.2 Read: because useAnimationControls returns an async function, you can sequence animations
     see an example of using sequence to open a menu
11.3 using dynamic element with useAnimationControls.start
11.4 Talk about the useAnimationControls methods:
     .set()
     .start() & also using it with transitionOverride
     .stop()

12. Talk about useAnimationFrame hook and give us an example

13. Talk about the useInView hook
    - what are the options that can be provided to this hook

14. Talk about keyframe's in framer-motion, also how do you space them using times
    - use it to animate the "cx" and the "cy" of an svg circle element
    - use times to control each of the keyframe for the "cx" and "cy" values

15. List at-least 5 gesture animation props
    - talk about whileHover
    - talk about whileTap

16. Talk about Layout animations
    - customizing layout animation duration
    - talk about layout scroll prop

17. - Drag, what values can the drag prop receive
    - talk about whileDrag
    - talk about dragSnapToOrigin
    - talk about dragConstraints
    - talk about dragElastic
    - talk about dragMomentum
    - talk about dragPropagation
    - talk about dragTransition
    - talk about onDrag, onDragStart, onDragEnd, onDirectionLock

17.1
    - talk about useDragControls
    - talk about dragListener
    - what do you do on touch-screen devices when using useDragControls?

18. tell us about these transition properties {when, delayChildren, staggerChildren, staggerDirection}
    - talk about dynamic variant

19. - Talk about useAnimate hook
    - Read: what can it be used for
    - use the useAnimate & usePresence hooks to animate a component when it exits the dom

20. Talk about event propagation(i.e bubbling up of an event)
    talk about the whileInView animation
        - using with variants
        - using with definitionObjects
        - using the viewport prop, customize the item so that whileInView will work only when visible inside
            the scrollable container & and only when 20% is visible

----------
21. transitions
    - List 3 types of transition
    - Types of built-in named easing functions
    - How do you ease with cubic-beiZer
    - How do you specify different easing functions for different "times" for different "keyframe" values
    - How do you repeat an animation + specify a repeat type & specifying a delay for the repeat

22. Read the answer - on supported values
    - value types that can be animated by motion
    - value type conversions
    - animating btw different color types/values

23. Transform origin
    - how do you set origin of x,y,z axis (use number and text)
    - what properties do you animate when animating an svg

24. - List some animation props that can be received by a motion component (6 props)
    - List some animation events that can be received by a motion component (3 events)

25. Read: What is MotionConfig and how can you use it?

26. - Re-order, create a component with a list of items that can be re-ordered using framer-motion

29. the "animate" function

    - animate a color, use the onUpdate call back & gsap.set()
    - animate a motion value hook
    - animate html/svg element

30. - Using the animate function to animate sequences (like gsap.timeline)
      after writing yours, look at the example and re-write it
    - Read: it is also possible to override transitions on a per-value bases in the definitions
    - using stagger for delays
    - what are the options that can be passed to the "stagger" function

    - explain all the at in the sequence below
        sequence = [
            [".product_cover", {x:100}, {duration:2}],
            "my-label" // my label is defined at 2s, because the last animation duration = 2s
            ["nav", {x:100}, {duration:1, at:0.5}],
            ["nav", {x:100}, {at:"+0.5"}],
            ["nav li", {opacity:1}, {delay: stagger(0.2), at:"-0.2"}],
            ["a", {scale: 1.2}, {at: "<"}],
            [".items", {x:400, y:10}, {at: "my-label"}],
        ]

        gsap.fromTo("div.box", {scaleX:0}, {scaleX:1, duration:1, ease:easeInOut})
        gsap.fromTo(boxRef.current, {background:"#fff"}, {background:"#000"})
