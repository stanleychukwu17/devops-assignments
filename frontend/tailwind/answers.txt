1 TailwindCss v4
  - installation
    pnpm i tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss

  - Core Configuration in CSS
    The most notable change is the deprecation of the tailwind.config.js file for most cases,
    Your main CSS file (e.g: app.css, global.css) is now where you'll import Tailwind and define
    your theme

    i.e @import "tailwindcss";

    You no longer need @tailwind base;, @tailwind components;, @tailwind utilities;
    The single @import "tailwindcss"; handles everything
