1.  
    - what methods do you use to animate when working with gsap
        we have 3 primary methods for Animating in gsap:
        - gsap.from
            gsap.from(selector, {x:"50px", y:-50, duration:1})

        - gsap.to
            gsap.to(selector, {x:100, y:100, color:'orange', duration:1})

        - gsap.fromTo
            gsap.fromTo(
                selector,
                {x:0, y:0, opacity:0, scale:.2},
                {x:50, y:50, opacity:1, scale:1.5, duration:.5, ease:"easeInOut"}
            )

    - gsap timeline with an example
        const tl = gsap.timeline({
            defaults: {
                duration: 1.5
            }
        })

        tl.from(".anim1", {y: -50, stagger:.6, opacity:0})
          .to("rule", {color:"red", cssRule: {scaleY:0}, duration:1}, "-=2.2")
          .from("aside", {backgroundPosition:"300px 0px", y: 30, opacity:0, delay:1.4}, "-=1")
          .from("img", {y: 30, opacity:0, delay:1.4}, 2.5)

        # explaining the timings
        -=2.2 := This is a relative timing, it is telling gsap to start the animation 2.2s before the
                previous animation comes to an end
        -=1 := This is also a relative timing, it tells gsap to start the animation 1s before the
                previous animation comes to an end
        2.5 := This is an absolute timing, it tells gsap to start the animation 2s after the overall
            timeline animation kicked off, so this one is not relative to any of it's siblings,
            but instead it is relative to the timeline & the timeline duration
