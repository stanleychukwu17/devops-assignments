    Css grids allows us to display contents(html elements) in grids on a webpage. A grid is made of columns
    and rows know as grid-cells. these cells are separated by grid-lines
    You decide how many columns and rows in your grid and where your contents are placed on the grid.

2. 
    - Each column and row has a line that make up the grid-cells, these lines are know as grid-lines
    - see image/1-grid-lines-01

3.
    A grid-gap is used to set a gap between the grid-cells of a grid, you can set this gap based on
    rows or columns or both
    1. grid-gap: 10px; or gap: 10px; give a margin of 10px on each row & column cells
    2. gap: 5px 10px; margin of 5px for each row-cell and 10px for each column-cell

4.
    - grid-template-rows & grid-template-columns

    - grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 50px) repeat(2, 100px)
      grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 300px) repeat(2, 200px)

5.
    - display the children elements on a grid system - on top of grid-cells
    - gap 15px 10px;
        give a gap of 15px on the each row-cell and 10px on each column-cell
    - grid-template-columns:
        used to set the number of columns on the grid and the sizes of this columns
    - grid-template-rows:
        used to set the number of rows on the grid and the sizes of this rows
    - grid-column:
        defines the column area the content should occupy, you can use it to specify the grid-column-line
        where the item should start from and the grid-column-line where the occupation should stop
    - grid-row:
        defines the row area the content should occupy, you can use it to specify the grid-row-line
        where the item should start from and the grid-row-line where the occupation should stop
    - grid-area:
        shortcut that combines grid-row and grid-column with a syntax of:
        grid-area: start-row/start-column/end-row/end-column

5.1
    - grid-column: 3 / -1; start from grid-column-line 3 and stop at the last grid-column-line
    - grid-row: 1 / -1; start from grid-row-line 1 and stop at the last grid-row-line
    - grid-area: 3/1/-1/-1; start-row/start-column/end-row/end-column


6. 
    - grid-column: 1 / span 3
        start from grid-column-line 1, and occupy 3 columns
    - grid-column: span 3
        start from the next available grid-column-line and occupy 3 columns
    - grid-column: span 1
        start from the next available grid-column-line and occupy 1 column
    - grid-column: 2 / 6
        start from grid-column-line 2, and stop at grid-column-line 6 columns
        equivalent = 2 / span 4
    - grid-column: 1 / 7
        start from grid-column-line 1, and stop at grid-column-line 7 columns
        equivalent = 1 / span 6
        equivalent = 1 / -1 (i.e if line 7 is the last line)
    - grid-column: 2
        start from grid-column-line 2, and just occupy 1 column
    - grid-column: 5
        start from grid-column-line 5, and just occupy 1 column
    - grid-column: 1 / -1
        start from grid-column-line 1, and stop at the last grid-column-line
    - grid-column: 3 / -1
        start from grid-column-line 3, and stop at the last grid-column-line

7.
    - grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 300px
        we are creating 3 columns, the 1st_col=100px; 2nd_col=200px; 3rd_col=300px;
    - grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr) repeat(3, 200px)
        we are creating a total of 5 rows
        the first 2 rows will take 1 fraction each from what is left after the (3, 200px)
        takes up their place (since their size are fixed, but fraction sizes are not fixed,
        they are dynamic and calculate their sizes based on the remaining available space)

8.
    justify-content & align-content
        justify-content and align-content affect the way a grid is displayed if they are any spaces left
        in the grid cell
        -
        justify-content aligns items along the horizontal axis(i.e y-axis)
        align-content aligns items along the vertical axis(i.e x-axis)
    justify-items & align-items
        justify-items & align-items affect the children of the grid-items (i.e if the children do not fully
        occupy total grid-cell assigned to the parent)
        -
        justify-items aligns the children along the horizontal axis(i.e y-axis)
        align-items aligns the children along the vertical axis(i.e x-axis)
    justify-self & align-self
        justify-self: this is used on the item it-self on the x-axis, it overrides the justify-items
            settings from the parent
        align-self: this is used on the item it-self on the y-axis, it overrides the justify-items
            settings from the parent

    - for the row:
        grid-template-rows: 100px 50px 1fr
        height: 1000px
        -
        we have 2 fixed rows which are 100px and 50px, so this row-sizes will first take their places, now
        what will be left is 1000px - 100px - 50px = 850px, so 1fr of 850px = 850px
        therefore 1fr = 850px
    - for the column:
        grid-template-columns: 100px 50px 2fr 1fr
        width: 1000px
        -
        we have 2 fixed columns which are 100px and 50px, so this column-sizes will first take their places,
        now what will b left is 1000px - 100px - 50px = 850px, now we hav 2 relative sizes which are 2fr & 1fr,
        i.e a total of 3fr, so to get the avg fr for the remaining width(i.e 850px), we will do
        avg_fr = 850px/3 = 283.33px
        2fr = 2*283.3 = 566.67px
        1fr = 283.33px

    - grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px), repeat(2, 1fr):
        this means, give us 3-rows @100px and 2-rows @1fr each of whatever space is left
    - grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 200px), repeat(2, 1fr):
        this means, give us 3-columns @200px and 2-columns @1fr each of whatever space is left

        use z-index to make .item1 overlap .item3, by default, all item on the grid is at z-index: 0,
        so when you set .item1 to z-index:1; it will overlap any other grid-item it intersects
        i.e
        .item1 {
            grid-row: 2/4;
            grid-column: 2/4;
            z-index: 1;
        }

    - What is grid-area and what is it syntax
        grid is a shortcut that you can use to replace grid-row & grid-column, the syntax is:
        grid-area: row-line-start / column-line-start/ row-line-end / column-line-end
    - Using grid-area, replace grid-column & grid-row for .item1, .item2 & .item3
        .item1 {
            grid-area: 2/2/4/4
        }
        .item2 {
            grid-area: 1/5/3/6
        }
        .item3 {
            grid-area: 2/3/5/5
        }

13.
    the focus of this question is on the grid-template-areas, the "." represents a grid-cell, so if you
    look at the number of grid-cells, it matches the total number of rows and columns defined in the
    grid-template-rows & grid-template-columns, looking at the grid-template-areas, you'll see we have
    5 rows and 5 columns

14. see images/3-grid-template-area

    based on the image provided, the .container class will look like:
    .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-rows: repeat(5, 1fr)
        grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr)
        grid-template-areas:
        "   item4       item4       .           .           .           item3   "
        "   item4       item4       item1       item1       item1       item3   "
        "   .           .           item2       item2       item2       item3   "
        "   item5       item5       item5       item5       .           item3   "
        "   item5       item5       item5       item5       .           item3   "
        ;

        .item1 {
            grid-area: item1
        }
        .item2 {
            grid-area: item2
        }
        .item3 {
            grid-area: item3
        }
        .item4 {
            grid-area: item4
        }
        .item5 {
            grid-area: item5
        }
    }

    - use media-query to solve it
        .container {
            display: grid
            justify-content: center;
            grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 150px)
            grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 100px)
            gap: 20px 20px;
        }

        # for tablet
        @media screen and (max-width: 1025px) {
            .container {
                grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px)
            }
        }

        # for phone
        @media screen and (max-width: 767px) {
            .container {
                grid-template-columns: 100px
            }
        }
    
    - use auto-fit to solve it
        .container {
            display: grid
            justify-content: center;
            grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 150px)
            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, 100px);
            gap: 20px 20px;
        }

    auto-fill:
        It fills the grid with as many columns (or rows) as will fit in the container, even if some of them are empty.
        e.g: grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
        This will create as many 200px wide columns as can fit in the container, even if some columns end up empty.

    auto-fit:
        Behavior: Similar to auto-fill, but it collapses empty columns (or rows) and allows the content to take
            up the available space. It essentially adjusts to fit the content while still providing flexibility.
        e.g: grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
        This will create as many 200px wide columns as can fit in the container, but any empty columns will not
            take up space, allowing the existing items to expand.

    Summary
        auto-fill: Fills the grid with items and keeps empty space.
        auto-fit: Fills the grid and collapses empty space, allowing items to take up available room.

    So let's we have a grid container where all the cells are filled up because of the way we styled the grid items
    e.g
    .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 100px)
        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 100px)
        grid-template-areas:
        "   item1   item1   "
        "   item2   item2   "
        ;
    }
    From the example, you can see that there are no grid-cells left, so lets say after 3 months, we added another
    grid-item and we forgot to adjust our grid-container to make space for the new grid-item, this new grid-item will
    automatically create a new row and jump to that row, but the height and width of the new row will be random since
    we did not provided a grid-cell for it.
    -
    (Any items/elements created outside the available grid-cells are called explicit-grids/explicit-grid-items)
    So to make sure that new grid-items maintain consistency with other grid-items (i.e has the same row-height like
    other grid-cells), we need to use the "grid-auto-rows" the property specifies a row-height for any explicit-grid.
    ...
    so
        grid-auto-flow: row; // this is not needed because the default for new explicit-grids are rows
        grid-auto-rows: 100px; // means explicit-grids row-height should be 100px
    ...
    for
        grid-auto-flow: column; // means let the default for explicit-grids be columns
        grid-auto-columns 100px; means explicit-grids column-width should be 100px
