    Css grids allows us to display contents(html elements) in grids on a webpage. A grid is made of columns
    and rows know as grid-cells.
    You decide how many columns and rows in your grid and where your contents are placed on the grid.

2. 
    - Each column and row has a line that make up the grid-cells, these lines are know as grid-lines
    - see image/1-grid-lines-01

3.
    A grid-gap is a gap between the columns and rows of a grid
    1. grid-gap: 10px; or gap: 10px; give a margin of 10px on each rows and columns (4 each grid-cell)
    2. gap: 5px 10px; margin of 5px for each row-cell and 10px for each column-cell

    - grid-template-columns & grid-template-rows

    -   grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 300px) repeat(2, 200px)
        grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 50px) repeat(2, 100px)

4.1
    - grid-column: 3 / -1; start from grid-column-line 3 and stop at the last grid-line
    - grid-row: 1 / -1; start from grid-row-line 1 and stop at the last grid-line
    - grid-area: 3/1/-1/-1; start-row/start-column/end-row/end-column

5.
    - display the children elements on a grid table
    - gap 15px 10px;
        give a gap of 15px on the each row-cell and 10px on each column-cell
    - grid-template-columns:
        used to set the number of columns on the grid
    - grid-template-rows:
        used to set the number of rows on the grid
    - grid-column:
        defines the column area the content should occupy
    - grid-row:
        defines the row area the content should occupy
    - grid-area:
        shortcut that combines grid-column and grid-row

6. 
    - grid-column: 1 / span 3
        start from grid-column-line 1, and occupy 3 columns
    - grid-column: span 3
        start from the next available grid-column-line and occupy 3 columns
    - grid-column: span 1
        start from the next available grid-column-line and occupy 1 column
    - grid-column: 2 / 6
        start from grid-column-line 2, and stop at grid-column-line 6 columns
        equivalent = 2 / span 4
    - grid-column: 1 / 7
        start from grid-column-line 1, and stop at grid-column-line 7 columns
    - grid-column: 2
        start from grid-column-line 2, and just occupy 1 column
    - grid-column: 5
        start from grid-column-line 5, and just occupy 1 column
    - grid-column: 1 / -1
        start from grid-column-line 1, and stop at the last grid-column-line
    - grid-column: 3 / -1
        start from grid-column-line 3, and stop at the last grid-column-line

7.
    - grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 300px
        we are creating 3 columns, the 1st_col=100px; 2nd_col=200px; 3rd_col=300px;
    - grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr) repeat(3, 200px)
        we are creating a total of 5 rows
        the first 2 rows will take 1 fraction each from what is left after the (3, 200px)
        takes up their place (since their size are fixed, but fraction sizes are not fixed,
        they are dynamic and calculate their sizes based on the remaining available space)

8.
    justify-content & align-content
        justify-content and align-content affect the way a grid is displayed if they are any spaces left
        if the grid cell
        -
        justify-content aligns items along the horizontal axis(i.e x-axis)
        align-content aligns items along the vertical axis(i.e y-axis)
    justify-items & align-items
        justify-items & align-items affect the children of the grid-items (i.e if the children do not fully
        occupy total grid-cell assigned to the parent)
        -
        justify-items aligns the children along the horizontal axis(i.e x-axis)
        align-items aligns the children along the vertical axis(i.e y-axis)
    justify-self & align-self
        justify-self: this is used on the item it-self on the x-axis, it overrides the justify-items
        settings from the parent
        align-item: this is used on the item it-self on the y-axis, it overrides the justify-items
        settings from the parent

    - for the row:
        grid-template-rows: 100px 50px 1fr
        height: 1000px
        -
        we have 2 fixed rows which are 100px and 50px, so this row-sizes will first take their places, now
        what will be left is 1000px - 100px - 50px = 850px, so 1fr of 850px = 50px
        therefore 1fr = 850px
    - for the column:
        grid-template-columns: 100px 50px 2fr 1fr
        width: 1000px
        -
        we have 2 fixed columns which are 100px and 50px, so this row-sizes will first take their places, now
        what will be left is 1000px - 100px - 50px = 850px, now we have 2 relative sizes which are 2fr & 1fr,
        i.e a total of 3fr, so to get the avg fr for the remaining width left(i.e 850px), we will do
        avg_fr = 850px/3 = 283.3px
        2fr = 2*283.3 = 566.6px
        1fr = 283.3px

    - grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px), repeat(2, 1fr):
        this means, give us 3-rows @100px and 2-rows @1fr each
    - grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 200px), repeat(2, 1fr):
        this means, give us 3-columns @200px and 2-columns @1fr each

        use z-index to make .item1 overlap .item3, by default, all item on the grid is at z-index: 0,
        so when you set .item1 to z-index:1; it will overlap any other grid-item it intersects
        i.e
        .item1 {
            grid-row: 2/4;
            grid-column: 2/4;
            z-index: 1;
        }

    - What is grid-area and what is it syntax
        grid is a shortcut that you can use to replace grid-row & grid-column, the syntax is:
        grid-area: row-line-start / column-line-start/ row-line-end / column-line-end
    - Using grid-area, replace grid-column & grid-row for .item1, .item2 & .item3
        .item1 {
            grid-area: 2/2/4/4
        }
        .item2 {
            grid-area: 1/5/3/6
        }
        .item3 {
            grid-area: 2/3/5/5
        }

    the focus of this question is on the grid-template-areas, the "." represents a grid-cell, so if you
    look at the number of grid-cells, it matches the total number of rows and columns defined in the
    grid-template-rows & grid-template-columns, looking at the grid-template-areas, you'll see we have
    5 rows and 5 columns
