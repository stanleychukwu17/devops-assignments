### Explanation of `scaleBand`:
- **`scaleBand()`**: the scale function is used for categorical data, where you have a finite set of distinct categories or groups (e.g., names of items, countries, months, etc.) scaleBand scales the band in the .domain() to match the value in .range() & each "band" represents a category (or a group).
  
  e.g:
  
  ```ts
    xScale = d3.scaleBand()
      .domain(["A","B","C","D","E","F"])
      .range([0, 1000])
  ```

  - **Domain**: The `domain()` method sets the input range, in this case, the names of the data items (`d.name`). This represents the distinct categories or groups in your dataset.
  - **Range**: The `range()` method sets the output range for the scale. Here, it specifies the width of the chart (`[0, chartWidth]`), so the bands will be distributed evenly across the width of the chart.
  - **Padding**: The `.padding(0.1)` adds some space between each band, which is useful to prevent the bars or elements from touching each other.

### `scaleLinear`?
`d3.scaleLinear()` is used for **continuous data** â€” when you have numeric data that spans a continuous range (like measurements, counts, or any value that could take any number within a given range)

- **`scaleLinear`** is for continuous values, like numbers between 0 and 100. It would stretch the data over the given range and interpolate values.
- **`scaleBand`**, on the other hand, is for discrete, categorical values where each category gets an equal "band" (space) along the axis.


### In Summary:
- **`scaleBand()`**: Used for **discrete, categorical data** (like bar charts, where each item has a fixed category).
- **`scaleLinear()`**: Used for **continuous numeric data** (like line charts or scatter plots, where the values are not fixed categories).
