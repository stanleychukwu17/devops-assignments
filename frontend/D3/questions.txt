=============
SECTION 1
=============

1.  - Read: What is D3
    - What are the 2 selection methods in D3
    - task write:
        - select a <body> & add a background-color of blue
        - select all <div> and change the color to red
        - select 1 <p> and:
            - change color to pink
            - add a attribute of class with value "active"
            - change the text to "Hello D3"

2.  How do you append & remove elements to the DOM

3.  Binding Data
    - Read: A little bit about Binding data
    - task write: data = [10,20,30,40,50]
        - select all <p> and bind the data to them
        - modify each text of the <p> to display it's "data value", e.g: "Value is [data]"
        - change the font-size of each <p> using the "data value"

4.  From Question 3
    - what happens if there are only 2 <p> elements in the DOM
    - how do you fix the issue where there the data values are more than the elements in the DOM
    - Task write: write the solution of the above using question 3 "task write"
    - .join() replaces the .enter().append() & .exit().remove(), see how it us used:

5.  .append() vs .join()
    - What is the difference btw .join() and .append()
    - .join task write: data: [1,2,3,4]
        - select all circles in an svg element and bind the data
        - for eah of this data, use the .join() method to create new circles for unbounded data
        - let the attribute of "cx" for each circle be: (d,i) => i * 50 + 25 (explain this)
        - let attribute cy:50, r:20 
    - .append task:
        see the example and explain

6.  SVG and D3
    - task write: data: [30, 70, 110, 150]
        - append <svg> to the <body>
        - change the width: 400, height: 400
        - select all circles in the svg and bind the data to them (create new circles if needed)
        - let each circle cx be (d,i) => i * 90 + 30
        - cy:50, r:[data value]
        - fill each circle with pink color

7. Scale functions
    - Read: a little bit about scale functions
    - give an example of a .scaleLinear() function using input:[0,100] and output:[0,500]
      then use it to create an x and y axis
    - Read: see an example where it was used & rewrite

8. Scale functions and Axes
    - talk about scaleLinear and scaleBand
    - give examples of scaleLinear and scaleBand

8.1 i asked chatGPT a question, see the question and answer

9. Transitions & Animations
    - select all circles and add a transition to it, with duration of 1000ms
    - add a delay of index * 100ms for each of the circle in the animation loop
    - animate the cx to 300
    - animate the r to 50
    - animate the fill color from yellow to blue
    -
    - Read: some explanations

10. Handling Events
    - select one circle and add:
    - mouseenter event, change color to blue
    - mouseleave event, change color to green
